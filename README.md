# Junior Applied Machine Learning Technical Test
This repository contains my solution to the *Junior Applied Machine Learning Technical Test*.  
It consist of two Jupyter notebooks, one for the coding test and one for the discussion test.

See [Coding Test](coding_test.ipynb).   

## Setup
Python 3.7 and Jupyter are required, as long as some external libraries (pandas, numpy, etc).  
If you have Anaconda or miniconda installed, you can quickly create an environment
by typing:
```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate applied-ml-challenge
```
